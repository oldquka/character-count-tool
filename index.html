    <!-- WHY COUNT SECTION -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2>Why Count?</h2>
      <p>Our Character & Word Counter isn’t just another bloated text analyzer - it’s a lean, lightning-fast utility that gives you exactly what you need (and nothing you don’t). 100% free, entirely client-side, and built with performance in mind, this tool measures characters, spaces, words, sentences, and paragraphs in real time, without a single server call or signup requirement. If you’ve ever lost precious minutes wrestling with slow, over-engineered editors, you’ll appreciate how refreshingly simple and reliable this is.</p>
      <p>How it works is delightfully straightforward: just paste or type your text into the box above, and watch the counts update instantly. No buttons to press, no waiting for a page reload, and no hidden limits on text length - as long as your browser can handle it, so can this tool. The moment you hit “space” or “enter,” you’ll see every character and word accounted for, along with a running tally of sentences and paragraphs.</p>
      <p>In today’s world, strict character and word limits are everywhere. Think beyond Twitter’s familiar 280-character cap: most SMS apps, Facebook posts, Pinterest descriptions, Yelp reviews, Reddit titles, eBay listings, and even LinkedIn headlines enforce hard limits. By seeing your counts as you type, you stay in control - never accidentally cut off your message or waste words padding your content.</p>
      <p>For students and academics, word-count requirements can make or break an assignment. Meeting minimums and staying under maximums proves you can follow guidelines, which often accounts for a significant portion of your grade. Our tool ensures you comply with essay prompts, college-application personal statements, or abstract submissions without guesswork.</p>
      <p>Professional writers working under tight spatial constraints - whether for magazines, newspapers, or ad copy - know that every character counts. You can experiment with fonts and line spacing, but it’s critical to know exactly how much text will fit your layout. This counter gives you immediate feedback, helping you craft the perfect headline, Instagram caption, or meta description without a second thought.</p>
      <p>Job seekers, too, rely on character-restricted formats: a concise, one-page résumé or a LinkedIn summary that hooks recruiters. Rather than fiddling endlessly with margins and font sizes, use our counter to fine-tune your content until it fits just right. It’s the simplest way to guarantee that your most important details never get truncated.</p>
      <p>Beyond raw counts, our tool is a powerful aid for anyone who cares about clarity and precision. Marketers refining ad copy, developers writing commit messages, or novelists sketching out chapters can all benefit from knowing their exact text length. And because it runs entirely in your browser, you enjoy maximum privacy and the ability to work offline - perfect for flights or low-connectivity zones.</p>
      <p>We’ve designed this tool with a minimalist, mobile-first philosophy: clean interface, rapid response, and accessibility at its core. No ads, no trackers, no pop-ups - just you and your words. In future updates, we’re planning added features like readability scoring, downloadable reports, and even integration as a browser extension or PWA. But right now, why wait? Paste your text in and experience the freedom of precise, instantaneous text analysis. It’s on you to write - it’s on us to count.</p>
